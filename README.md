# chatter 
Chat app.
My training project to deepen the topics of pure architecture and work with Stream

In this application I used a clean architecture with Bloc/Cubit, the backend was responsible for getstream.io and FirebaseAuth.
In this app you can create private and group chats.
Log in with Google, Guest Auth.
Also you can change ui theme.

How to install?
```
git clone https://github.com/AlexandrMolecule/chatter
cd chatter
flutter packages get
flutter run
```
