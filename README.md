# chatter 
Chat app.
My training project to deepen the topics of pure architecture and work with Stream

In this application I used a clean architecture with Bloc/Cubit, the backend was responsible for getstream.io and FirebaseAuth.
In this app you can create private and group chats.
Log in with Google, Guest Auth.
Also you can change ui theme.
